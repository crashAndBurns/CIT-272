// They are a good way to demonstrate object oriented programming
// concepts.

// Makes use of the Java Swing Library
// you usually build a GUI around a library not an operating system
// Swing is good because it works across multiple operating systems

// We'll be using straight coded GUIs instead of using abuilder like VB

// Top Level Containers
// three main windows are all objects with internal attributes 
// and properties:
// - JFram
// - JDialogue
// - JApplets

// JFrame
// -- Menu bar at top of frame (optional)
// -- Content pane (where the actual content is displayed)
// -- Think of these as attributes of a JFrame!
// -- JFrame is an application window
