// Use similar linked structure as linked lists
// Most common data structures covered in schools
// limited versions of linked lists.

// In some cases we want to restrict how you interact with the data
// structure so that it can only be used as designed. For security and
// preventing bugs.

// Stacks:
// Resembles the concept of a stack in every day use. 
// Overall concept, the last item put in the stack is the first one
// used by the user. IE Last in First out.

// Always add to the top of the stack, when we remove from the stack
// we aren't looking for any particular item, we are looing for the top
// node. In a classic stack you can only add or remove from the top of 
// the list.  You can also peek at the top of the list.
